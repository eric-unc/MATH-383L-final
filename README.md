# MATH-383L-final
This project is the code for my final project for MATH 383L: First Course in Differential Equations Laboratory. The rest of the project (paper and presentation) will be linked to from here later.

This final project compares real world results of water warming to room temperature to the predictions genered by various numerical analysis methods such as Euler's method.

This code is all in MATLAB. It's just generating some graphs, and comparing various numberical analysis techniques to do it. `Main.m` is the main file which generates everything, and `data.csv` has the data from my little experiment.

This is a big WIP at the moment.
