# MATH-383L-final
This project is the code for my final project for MATH 383L: First Course in Differential Equations Laboratory.

This final project compares real world results of water warming to room temperature to the predictions generated through numerical analysis.

This code is all in MATLAB. It's just generating some graphs, and comparing various numberical analysis techniques to do it. `Main.m` is the main file which generates everything, and `data.csv` has the data from my little experiment.
