# MATH-383L-final
This project is the code for my final project for MATH 383L: First Course in Differential Equations Laboratory. The rest of the project (paper and presentation) will be linked to from here later.

This code is all in MATLAB. We're just generating some graphs, and using various numberical analysis techniques to do it.

This is a big WIP at the moment.
